# ContextControl

ContextControl is a native desktop workbench for keeping local code context, local models, and patch workflows under the user's control.

The current release focuses on a Windows x64 desktop app that can be opened like a normal EXE, then used to install local LLM dependencies and download model weights on demand. The older PowerShell CLI pipeline is still included as the core deterministic context engine.

## Install On Windows

Latest release:

https://github.com/VulkanVX/contextcontrol/releases/latest

For a fresh Windows PC, download only the installer:

```text
ContextControl-win-x64-Setup.exe
```

You do not need to download a separate app zip. The setup EXE is a single-file installer that already contains the full ContextControl app folder. It asks for the install location, shortcut options, optional WebView2 Runtime install, and whether to launch when setup finishes.

Default install folder:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\ContextControl
```

After install, run ContextControl from the Start Menu shortcut or from:

```text
<install folder>\ContextControl.Workbench.exe
```

The app is self-contained, so a separate .NET runtime install is not required.
The installer registers a per-user Windows uninstall entry, so you can remove it from Windows **Installed apps / Apps & features** or from the Start Menu `Uninstall ContextControl` shortcut.

After this version is installed, ContextControl checks GitHub releases on startup when internet is available. The header bar also has a **Check updates** button; when a newer release exists, the same button downloads the newest setup EXE with the normal transfer progress bar, starts it against the current install folder, then closes the running Workbench so setup can replace the app files safely.

Update behavior:

- The updater reuses an already downloaded installer for the same release instead of downloading the full setup EXE again.
- Stale update downloads from older versions are cleaned from the temp update cache when possible.
- The live-update handoff waits for the running Workbench process to exit before opening setup, so app files are not replaced while the app is still using them.
- Setup compares installed files with the embedded payload and writes only changed files; unchanged files are skipped.

ContextControl currently ships updates as a full setup EXE. That means a new release still downloads the full installer once, but repeated attempts for the same release should not download another copy.

GitHub's automatic **Source code** downloads are source snapshots, not runnable app packages. Use them only if you want to build from source.

## What Is Bundled

Bundled inside the installer:

- ContextControl Workbench native desktop app
- PowerShell ContextControl CLI scripts
- ContextControl `lib/` modules and default `skillbook/` file
- Release appearance defaults
- Full Windows app folder with runtime files beside the EXE
- Setup UI with install folder picker, shortcut options, uninstall registration, logs, and quiet install mode

Not bundled:

- LLM model weights
- Ollama models
- Python packages for model backends
- GPU drivers, CUDA toolkits, or vendor runtimes
- Chat history, project exports, patch files, or local runtime state

Those are created or downloaded only after the user chooses them in the app.

If the app fails before the main window opens, it writes a crash log beside the installed EXE and to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ContextControl\workbench-crash.log`.

## Current Status

Stable enough to test:

- Windows x64 installer
- Project file tree and project scanner views
- Local LLM catalog
- Dependency detection and one-click installers where safe
- Ollama model pull/remove workflow
- Basic local chat through supported chat-ready models
- Image generation through Diffusers models and the stable-diffusion.cpp runner route on Windows; experimental Ollama image models are cataloged but macOS-only
- Startup and manual GitHub release update checks
- Theme and appearance settings

Work in progress:

- Context Control prompting flow in the desktop app
- Skillbook UI and behavior; it currently does not work as a usable feature
- Non-Windows packaged releases
- Some advanced GPU/server model backends

The CLI scripts remain the conservative path for the original DIR/CC/GO patch pipeline while the desktop prompting flow matures.

## Local LLM And Dependency Install

The app separates dependencies from model weights.

Dependencies are runtimes and libraries such as Ollama, llama.cpp, Python packages, or backend servers. Models are the actual weights, usually much larger. ContextControl does not download large model weights during app install.

One-click dependency install currently covers **17/17** dependency cards shown by the app. These are installer buttons for runtimes/backends, not model weights:

| Category | Autosetup dependencies |
|---|---|
| Package manager apps | Ollama, LM Studio, Python 3.12 bootstrap for managed Python backends |
| Managed Python environments | Diffusers, Transformers, MLX LM, MLC LLM, vLLM, SGLang, OpenVINO GenAI, ONNX Runtime GenAI, TensorRT-LLM, ExLlamaV2 / TabbyAPI |
| Native portable downloads | llama.cpp server, KoboldCpp, stable-diffusion.cpp, RWKV Runner |
| Source archive setup | bitnet.cpp source checkout |

On a fresh Windows PC, ContextControl ignores the Microsoft Store `python.exe` alias in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps` because that is not a real interpreter. If no usable Python is found, installing a Python-backed dependency such as Diffusers bootstraps Python 3.12 through `winget`, then creates a ContextControl-managed virtual environment.

Catalog-wide model autosetup coverage in the current catalog:

| Model route | Count |
|---|---:|
| Ollama local model pull | 262/302 |
| Non-Ollama managed/backend setup | 12/302 |
| Ollama Cloud entries, no local weight download | 28/302 |
| Local autosetup path, excluding cloud | 274/302 |
| Any app route, including cloud | 302/302 |
| Windows/Linux enabled routes, excluding macOS-only Ollama image models | 299/302 |

Important caveat: "autosetup" means ContextControl has a button or route for the next safe setup step. It does not mean every backend is fully hands-off after that. Large model weights, vendor drivers, CUDA/WSL setup, cloud sign-in, model licenses, and some server launch steps can still be external.

Autosetup pieces that are still WIP or partial:

| Dependency | Current state |
|---|---|
| LM Studio | App install can be started through the OS package manager; enabling and managing its local server is still manual. |
| stable-diffusion.cpp | Runner install is automatic; GGUF diffusion model file selection/download is still manual through `CC_IMAGE_MODEL_PATH`. |
| bitnet.cpp | Source checkout is automatic; full environment setup and BitNet model weight flow are still WIP. |
| RWKV Runner | Runner download is automatic; RWKV model weights and launch integration are still WIP. |
| MLX LM | Python package setup exists, but it is useful only on Apple Silicon/macOS. |
| MLC LLM | Package setup exists; compiled model artifacts and target-specific runtime flow are still WIP. |
| vLLM, SGLang | Python package setup exists; CUDA/WSL/server validation and model serving flow are still WIP. |
| ONNX Runtime GenAI, OpenVINO GenAI | Package setup exists; converted model artifacts and runtime wiring are still WIP. |
| TensorRT-LLM, ExLlamaV2 / TabbyAPI | Package setup exists; NVIDIA/CUDA environment, model artifacts, and server workflow are still WIP. |

Image generation status:

- 13/13 image-generation catalog entries have a route in the app.
- 3 use experimental Ollama image models: FLUX.2 Klein 4B, FLUX.2 Klein 9B, and Z-Image Turbo. Ollama currently documents these image-generation models as macOS-only, so ContextControl disables their Ollama download/use buttons on Windows/Linux to avoid raw Ollama HTTP 500/EOF failures. Already-pulled copies can still be uninstalled.
- 8 use Diffusers and expose a model-card **Download** action for Hugging Face weights after the Diffusers dependency is ready; first generation can still fill any missing cache files. This includes the Windows/Linux-capable `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B` route for FLUX.2 Klein.
- 2 use stable-diffusion.cpp and still need the user to point `CC_IMAGE_MODEL_PATH` at a local GGUF diffusion model file.

The default image-generation selection is Tiny Stable Diffusion (`segmind/tiny-sd`) because it is small enough for fresh Windows installs and is useful for validating that Python, Torch, and Diffusers are working before downloading larger checkpoints. For FLUX.2 Klein on Windows, use the Diffusers entry, not the `x/flux2-klein` Ollama entry.

## Windows Download Warnings

Windows SmartScreen may warn on new unsigned installers even when the file is clean. The technical fix is Authenticode code signing with an OV/EV certificate and enough download reputation over time. The release workflow supports optional certificate-based signing through repository secrets, but public builds remain unsigned until a signing certificate is configured.

## Main Workbench Areas

- **Local LLMs**: browse models, see fit notes, pull Ollama models, and route chat/image tasks.
- **Dependencies**: detect installed backends and install managed dependencies.
- **Project Files**: open a project folder and inspect source structure.
- **Project Graph**: visualize project structure and export graph views.
- **Scanner**: summarize project stack, languages, manifests, and important files.
- **Conversation**: use local model chat with ContextControl context where supported.
- **Browser**: embedded WebView2 surface on Windows.

## Context Control Prompting Flow

The original ContextControl pipeline is deterministic:

1. `ccDir.ps1` exports a filtered project tree.
2. `cc.ps1` exports selected files or functions.
3. `ccReplace.ps1` applies explicit `CC-REPLACE` patch blocks.

The desktop app is being built around the same idea, but the prompting flow is still WIP. Treat generated request lines, prompt capsules, and Skillbook-assisted instructions as active development areas.

## Skillbook

`skillbook/` contains draft local-model instruction material, but the desktop Skillbook feature is currently not working as a usable feature. Treat it as bundled draft data only until the UI behavior, defaults, activation, and long-term format are rebuilt.

## Build From Source

Requirements:

- Windows for the release installer EXE
- .NET 9 SDK
- PowerShell

Run the tests:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\ide\ContextControl.Workbench.Tests\ContextControl.Workbench.Tests.csproj --configuration Release
```

Run the app from source:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\ide\ContextControl.Workbench\ContextControl.Workbench.csproj
```

Build release artifacts:

```powershell
.\packaging\Publish-ContextControlRelease.ps1
```

Output goes to:

```text
.tmp\release\
```

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/contextcontrol-release.yml` publishes the Windows installer when a `v*` tag is pushed. The release script also creates a local app-folder zip as the installer payload and for developer smoke testing, but end users only need the setup EXE.

## Repository Layout

```text
.github/workflows/                 Release workflow
ide/ContextControl.Workbench/       Avalonia desktop app
ide/ContextControl.Workbench.Tests/ Focused smoke tests
lib/                                Shared PowerShell pipeline modules
packaging/                          Release and installer scripts
skillbook/                          Draft local-model instruction material
cc*.ps1, cc*.cmd                    CLI entry points
```

Ignored local runtime files include `.tmp/`, `.ccReplace.versions/`, `.ccWorkbench.*`, generated exports, patch files, build output, and user settings.

## Privacy Model

ContextControl is local-first. The app scans projects and runs local child processes on the user's machine. Model weights and dependency runtimes are installed only after the user chooses them. Local LLM backends are separate programs, so review each backend before installing it.
